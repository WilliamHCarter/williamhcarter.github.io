## Overview
This portfolio webite is designed to be a minimal and interactive site to host my projects, while exploring the workflow and features of a new web stack.
Astro and SolidJS were chosen for their strong combination of partial hydration and a small framework bundle size, resulting in a very fast, yet still reactive web experience.
