## Overview

This portfolio website is designed to be a minimal and interactive site to showcase my projects while exploring the workflow and features of a new web stack. Astro and SolidJS were chosen for their strong combination of partial hydration and a small framework bundle size, resulting in a very fast, yet still reactive web experience. The design is enhanced by the power of Tailwind CSS for responsive styling and consistent visuals.

## Features

- Fast performance due to optimized static site generation with Astro
- Reactive UI components powered by SolidJS for seamless user experience
- Modern and responsive design with the help of Tailwind CSS
- Lazy loading of images and other media for faster loading times
- Automatic support for light and dark mode
- SEO-friendly metadata and structure for improved search rankings
